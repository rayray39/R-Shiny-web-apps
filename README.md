# R-Shiny-web-apps
Web applications that I created using R Shiny tools

Project Description:

Forbes Billionaires Web App
    - This app serves to inform users about the list of billionaires in 2022
    - It categorizes the billionaires by industry, in a histogram
    - A scatter plot (networth VS age) shows Singapore's billionaires
    - 3 histograms show the billionaires by industry in USA, Germany and China
    
    Special Features:
    - the Main Tab includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to select which data set is to be displayed as a histogram.
    - in the Singapore's Richest scatter plot, clicking on the plot displays the coordinates of the point at the bottom of the plot, allowing users to accurately view 
      the networth and age of the point selected.
    - The Big 3 tab uses radio buttons to interactively change the histogram displayed on the screen based on user selection.

Programming Languages Trend Web App
    - This app serves to assist users in making a decision regarding which programming lauguage to learn
    - There are 2 separate line plots showcasing usage trends from 2004-2021
    
    Special Features:
    - the first graph plot superimposes 7 different line plots, representing 7 different popular programming languages, all with different colors. An accompanying legend
      is attached to the right of the plot.
